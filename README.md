# **Dotfiles i3wm**

These are the dots for my i3 setup, not as aesthetic as a setup on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn), but it is good for me.

These dots contain the scripts I use in my i3 setup to show notifications for volume, or brightness, along with the systemd services that I use for the tasks, for someone's easy reference, since when I was configuring my system, I faced a few issues.

These dots are not final, and I will keep adding things as and when I modify my system more so.
